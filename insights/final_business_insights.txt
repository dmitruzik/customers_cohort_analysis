

Overall retention performance

Average Month-1 retention: 32.0%
Average Month-3 retention: 33.7%

Insight:
Only about 1 in 3 customers return after the first month, and retention does not significantly improve by Month 3. This indicates early churn is the primary challenge, not long-term engagement.

Early churn is the biggest drop-off point

From the cohort heatmap and line chart:

Retention drops sharply from Month 0 → Month 1
After Month 2–3, retention stabilizes at ~25–35%

Later-month retention fluctuates but does not collapse further

Insight:
Customers who make it past the first month are much more likely to stay, suggesting the activation phase is critical.

High variability between cohorts

Observed patterns:

Some cohorts show strong Month-2 / Month-3 recovery
Others experience rapid decay
Later cohorts appear slightly more stable, but inconsistency remains

📌 Insight:
Retention is not uniform across cohorts, implying:
Changes in acquisition quality
Seasonal effects

Product or pricing experiments impacting user behavior

No clear long-term retention growth trend yet
No consistent upward trend across newer cohorts
Performance improvements appear sporadic, not systemic

Insight:
Recent cohorts have not yet demonstrated a sustained retention improvement, meaning optimizations may not be addressing root causes.

Retention pattern summary (what this tells the business)
Stage	Behavior
Month 0 → 1	🔻 Major churn
Month 1 → 3	⚠️ Partial recovery / stabilization
Month 4+	➖ Flat, predictable retention

This indicates a classic activation problem, not a loyalty problem.

 Business Recommendations
1️⃣ Improve first-month activation (highest impact)

Focus on:

Onboarding improvements

First-purchase incentives

Clear value proposition in the first 7–14 days

📈 Expected impact: Immediate M1 retention lift

2️⃣ Segment acquisition channels by retention

Analyze:

Paid vs organic cohorts

Campaign-level retention

Discount-driven vs full-price users

📈 Expected impact: Higher quality cohorts

3️⃣ Introduce Month-2 retention hooks

Examples:

Loyalty points unlocked after 2nd purchase

Personalized offers at Day 25–30

📈 Expected impact: Stronger M3 stabilization

4️⃣ Track retention improvements by cohort

Use this dashboard monthly to:

Validate experiments

Detect regressions early

Measure cohort-level improvements

📈 Expected impact: Data-driven iteration cycle
